<p>About twenty years ago Jobs and Wozniak, the founders of Apple, came up with the <br> very strange idea of selling information processing machines for use in the home. The <br> business took off, and its founders made a lot of money and received the credit they <br> deserved for being daring visionaries. But around the same time, Bill Gates and Paul <br> Allen came up with an idea even stranger and more fantastical: selling computer <br> operating systems. This was much weirder than the idea of Jobs and Wozniak. A <br> computer at least had some sort of physical reality to it. It came in a box, you could <br> open it up and plug it in and watch lights blink. An operating system had no tangible <br> incarnation at all. It arrived on a disk, of course, but the disk was, in effect, nothing <br> more than the box that the OS came in. The product itself was a very long string of <br> ones and zeroes that, when properly installed and coddled, gave you the ability to <br> manipulate other very long strings of ones and zeroes. Even those few who actually <br> understood what a computer operating system was were apt to think of it as a <br> fantastically arcane engineering prodigy, like a breeder reactor or a U-2 spy plane, and <br> not something that could ever be (in the parlance of high-tech) "productized."</p>

<p>Yet now the company that Gates and Allen founded is selling operating systems like <br> Gillette sells razor blades. New releases of operating systems are launched as if they <br> were Hollywood blockbusters, with celebrity endorsements, talk show appearances, <br> and world tours. The market for them is vast enough that people worry about whether <br> it has been monopolized by one company. Even the least technically-minded people in <br> our society now have at least a hazy idea of what operating systems do; what is more, <br> they have strong opinions about their relative merits. It is commonly understood, even <br> by technically unsophisticated computer users, that if you have a piece of software <br> that works on your Macintosh, and you move it over onto a Windows machine, it will <br> not run. That this would, in fact, be a laughable and idiotic mistake, like nailing <br> horseshoes to the tires of a Buick.</p>

<p>A person who went into a coma before Microsoft was founded, and woke up now, <br> could pick up this morning's <em>New York Times</em> and understand everything in it--almost:</p>

<li><strong>Item:</strong> the richest man in the world made his fortune from-what? <br> Railways? Shipping? Oil? No, operating systems.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Item:</strong> the Department of Justice is tackling Microsoft's supposed OS <br>monopoly with legal tools that were invented to restrain the power of <br> Nineteenth-Century robber barons.</li>
<li><strong>Item:</strong> a woman friend of mine recently told me that she'd broken off a <br> (hitherto) stimulating exchange of e-mail with a young man. At first he <br> had seemed like such an intelligent and interesting guy, she said, but <br> then "he started going all PC-versus-Mac on me."</li>
</ul>
<p>What the hell is going on here? And does the operating system business have a future, <br> or only a past? Here is my view, which is entirely subjective; but since I have spent a <br> fair amount of time not only using, but programming, Macintoshes, Windows <br> machines, Linux boxes and the BeOS, perhaps it is not so ill-informed as to be <br> completely worthless. This is a subjective essay, more review than research paper, and <br> so it might seem unfair or biased compared to the technical reviews you can find in <br> PC magazines. But ever since the Mac came out, our operating systems have been <br> based on metaphors, and anything with metaphors in it is fair game as far as I'm <br> concerned.</p>

<h2>MGBs, TANKS, AND BATMOBILES</h2>

<p>Around the time that Jobs, Wozniak, Gates, and Allen were dreaming up these <br> unlikely schemes, I was a teenager living in Ames, Iowa. One of my friends' dads had <br> an old MGB sports car rusting away in his garage. Sometimes he would actually <br> manage to get it running and then he would take us for a spin around the block, with a <br> memorable look of wild youthful exhiliration on his face; to his worried passengers, <br> he was a madman, stalling and backfiring around Ames, Iowa and eating the dust of <br> rusty Gremlins and Pintos, but in his own mind he was Dustin Hoffman tooling across <br> the Bay Bridge with the wind in his hair.</p>

<p>In retrospect, this was telling me two things about people's relationship to technology. <br> One was that romance and image go a long way towards shaping their opinions. If you <br> doubt it (and if you have a lot of spare time on your hands) just ask anyone who owns<br>  a Macintosh and who, on those grounds, imagines him- or herself to be a member of <br> an oppressed minority group.</p>

<p>The other, somewhat subtler point, was that interface is very important. Sure, the MGB <br> was a lousy car in almost every way that counted: balky, unreliable, underpowered.<br> But it was fun to drive. It was responsive. Every pebble on the road was felt in the <br> bones, every nuance in the pavement transmitted instantly to the driver's hands. He <br> could listen to the engine and tell what was wrong with it. The steering responded <br> immediately to commands from his hands. To us passengers it was a pointless <br>
<hr>
exercise in going nowhere--about as interesting as peering over someone's shoulder <br> while he punches numbers into a spreadsheet. But to the driver it was an experience. <br> For a short time he was extending his body and his senses into a larger realm, and <br> doing things that he couldn't do unassisted.</p>

<p>The analogy between cars and operating systems is not half bad, and so let me run <br> with it for a moment, as a way of giving an executive summary of our situation today.</p>

<p>Imagine a crossroads where four competing auto dealerships are situated. One of them <br> (Microsoft) is much, much bigger than the others. It started out years ago selling <br> three-speed bicycles (MS-DOS); these were not perfect, but they worked, and when <br> they broke you could easily fix them.</p>

<p>There was a competing bicycle dealership next door (Apple) that one day began <br> selling motorized vehicles--expensive but attractively styled cars with their innards <br> hermetically sealed, so that how they worked was something of a mystery.</p>

<p>The big dealership responded by rushing a moped upgrade kit (the original Windows)<br> onto the market. This was a Rube Goldberg contraption that, when bolted onto a <br> three-speed bicycle, enabled it to keep up, just barely, with Apple-cars. The users had <br> to wear goggles and were always picking bugs out of their teeth while Apple owners <br> sped along in hermetically sealed comfort, sneering out the windows. But the Micro-<br>mopeds were cheap, and easy to fix compared with the Apple-cars, and their market <br> share waxed.</p>

<p>Eventually the big dealership came out with a full-fledged car: a colossal station <br> wagon (Windows 95). It had all the aesthetic appeal of a Soviet worker housing block, <br> it leaked oil and blew gaskets, and it was an enormous success. A little later, they also <br> came out with a hulking off-road vehicle intended for industrial users (Windows NT)<br> which was no more beautiful than the station wagon, and only a little more reliable.</p>

<p>Since then there has been a lot of noise and shouting, but little has changed. The <br> smaller dealership continues to sell sleek Euro-styled sedans and to spend a lot of <br> money on advertising campaigns. They have had GOING OUT OF BUSINESS! signs <br> taped up in their windows for so long that they have gotten all yellow and curly. The <br> big one keeps making bigger and bigger station wagons and ORVs.</p>

<p>On the other side of the road are two competitors that have come along more recently.</p>

<p>One of them (Be, Inc.) is selling fully operational Batmobiles (the BeOS). They are <br> more beautiful and stylish even than the Euro-sedans, better designed, more <br>
<hr>

technologically advanced, and at least as reliable as anything else on the market--and <br> yet cheaper than the others.</p>

<p>With one exception, that is: Linux, which is right next door, and which is not a <br> business at all. It's a bunch of RVs, yurts, tepees, and geodesic domes set up in a field <br> and organized by consensus. The people who live there are making tanks. These are <br> not old-fashioned, cast-iron Soviet tanks; these are more like the M1 tanks of the U.S. <br> Army, made of space-age materials and jammed with sophisticated technology from <br> one end to the other. But they are better than Army tanks. They've been modified in <br> such a way that they never, ever break down, are light and maneuverable enough to <br> use on ordinary streets, and use no more fuel than a subcompact car. These tanks are <br> being cranked out, on the spot, at a terrific pace, and a vast number of them are lined <br> up along the edge of the road with keys in the ignition. Anyone who wants can simply <br> climb into one and drive it away for free.</p>

<p>Customers come to this crossroads in throngs, day and night. Ninety percent of them <br> go straight to the biggest dealership and buy station wagons or off-road vehicles. They <br> do not even look at the other dealerships.</p>

<p>Of the remaining ten percent, most go and buy a sleek Euro-sedan, pausing only to <br> turn up their noses at the philistines going to buy the station wagons and ORVs. If <br> they even notice the people on the opposite side of the road, selling the cheaper, <br> technically superior vehicles, these customers deride them cranks and half-wits.</p>

<p>The Batmobile outlet sells a few vehicles to the occasional car nut who wants a <br> second vehicle to go with his station wagon, but seems to accept, at least for now, that <br> it's a fringe player.</p>

<p>The group giving away the free tanks only stays alive because it is staffed by <br> volunteers, who are lined up at the edge of the street with bullhorns, trying to draw <br> customers' attention to this incredible situation. A typical conversation goes <br> something like this:</p>

<p>Hacker with bullhorn: "Save your money! Accept one of our free tanks! It is <br> invulnerable, and can drive across rocks and swamps at ninety miles an hour while <br> getting a hundred miles to the gallon!"</p>

<p>Prospective station wagon buyer: "I know what you say is true...but...er...I don't <br> know how to maintain a tank!"</p>

<p><em>Bullhorn:</em> "You don't know how to maintain a station wagon either!"</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Buyer:</em> "But this dealership has mechanics on staff. If something goes wrong with my <br >station wagon, I can take a day off work, bring it here, and pay them to work on it <br> while I sit in the waiting room for hours, listening to elevator music."</p>

<p><em>Bullhorn:</em> "But if you accept one of our free tanks we will send volunteers to your <br> house to fix it for free while you sleep!"</p>

<p><em>Buyer:</em> "Stay away from my house, you freak!"</p>

<p><em>Bullhorn:</em> "But..."</p>
